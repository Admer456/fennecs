*(cuddly, lively, come in litters of `1,073,741,824`)*

An Entity is a specific type of ==Identity== (a 64-bit number) associated with a specific [World](/docs/World.md).

Entities can have any number of [Components](/docs/Components/) attached to them. This is how the **fenn**ecs Entity-Component Systems provides composable, structured data semantics. 

Entities with the identical combinations of Component ==Type Expressions== share the same [Archetype](../Components/index.md#archetype).
